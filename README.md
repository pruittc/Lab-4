This is a donut pie chart that can be used for many different statistic vizualizations. This pie is representing the total mileage of a sprint triathlon The whole pie is 100%, so different sections represent different percentages from that 100. Ratio and percentages are the best data to use. I would like to acknowledge David Buezas for supplying the coding to create the pie chart. 

The first part of the coding is choosing the the font, dimensions, sizing, and color of the slice and line and radius.
Next, we state the colors and labels we want. In this case we're randomizing the slice size because I didn't actually put data in it.
