# Lab-4
This is a donut chart that can be used for many different statistic vizualizations. It is essentially a pie chart, but with a hole in the middle. It is used to show data intensity ratios and the hole provides more space for a legend or any other information one wants to add about the chart. This pie is representing the total distance in miles of a sprint triathlon The whole pie represents 15.57 miles which in this case is 100%, so different sections represent different legs which all have varying lengths. Ratio and percentages are the best data to use. I would like to acknowledge David Buezas for supplying the coding to create the pie chart on D3. I would also like to thank Vicky Gisel for supplying code for the updated version (v4) from [blockbuilder.org](https://bl.ocks.org/vickygisel/c3f4eb2b16b86dd0f641263383f05a13). 

The first part of the coding is choosing the the font, dimensions, sizing, and color of the slice and line and radius.
Next, we state the colors and labels we want. In this case we're randomizing the slice size because I didn't actually put data in it.
